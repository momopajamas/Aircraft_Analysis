## Overview
This project looks at data regarding reported aviation crashes since the 1940s, encompassing the details of the aircrafts, severity of the damage and injuries, weather during the incident, etc. <br/><br/>
The original dataset can be found here: [Aviation Accident Database & Synopses](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses?resource=download&select=AviationData.csv) <br/><br/>
Since my employers seek to invest in aircrafts, I distill this data into its most useful form, and provide a number of recommendations based on analysis of this distilled data, namely that I recommend: 
1) An aircraft with 2-4 engines.
2) An aircraft with the Turbo Fan type of engine.
3) The Cessna make of aircraft.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning


### Confounding Factors
As can be expected, there were a number of factors that were not accounted for in the original dataset that would reasonably assumed to have had an impact on the results and analysis, namely:
* Age of the aircraft
* Aircraft maintenance policies of the airlines
* Experience and talent of the pilot

## Data Visualizations
Below, you will find data visualizations demonstrating the following: <br/>
1) Aircraft accidents that have the Turbo Fan engine type have much lower rates of serious and minor injuries, and higher rates of uninjured.
2) Aircrafts with 2-4 engines have lower rates of damage severity to the vehicles.
3) Upon considering the make of the aicraft in conjuunction with number of engines, Cessna aircrafts with 4 engines have the lowest rates of severe damage. <br/><br/>
